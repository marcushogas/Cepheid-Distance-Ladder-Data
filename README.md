# Cepheid-Distance-Ladder-Data
This repository contains the dataset used in the paper [arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN](link-to-paper) which is a reanalysis of the SH0ES team's calibration of the Cepheid-based cosmic distance ladder. Data are stored as txt-files; y is the data vector, C is the covariance matrix, L is the design matrix, and q is a list of the model parameters.

## [SH0ES2022](SH0ES2022/)
In this folder, we store the data files pertaining to the baseline 2022 SH0ES team ([Riess et al. 2022a](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ac5c5b)) calibration of the cosmic distance ladder.

## [SH0ES2024_updates](SH0ES2024_updates)
In this folder, we store the data files pertaining to the updated 2024 SH0ES-team calibration, as described in more detail in [arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN](link-to-paper). Including
- MW cluster Cepheids ([Riess et al. 2022b](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8f24))
- Updated MW metallicities ([Bhardwaj et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acf710))
- Updated SN covariance ([Murakami et al. 2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2023/11/046))
- SMC as an anchor galaxy ([Breuval et al. 2024](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad630e))
