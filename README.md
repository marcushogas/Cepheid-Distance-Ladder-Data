# Cepheid-Distance-Ladder-Data
This repository contains the dataset used in the paper [arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN](link-to-paper) which is a reanalysis of the SH0ES team's calibration of the Cepheid-based cosmic distance ladder. Data are stored as txt-files; y is the data vector, C is the covariance matrix, L is the design matrix, and q is a list of the model parameters. Please contact marcus(dot)hogas(at)fysik(dot)su(dot)se if you see a problem.
